Most of the problems I faced had to do with figuring out how to use the tools.
A lot of this stuff I didn't entirely remember, so I had to go digging through
old notes, assignments, class slides, and the internet to figure out how to use
them all again.

I didn't really run into any major bugs that had me stumped for a long time. I
mostly just made steady progress implementing all the project requirements,
looking up certain things I didn't know or forgot along the way.
