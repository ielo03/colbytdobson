<p><strong>Jeffrey (M28):</strong> &quot;As as avid alcoholic I usually make myself a nice Rum Punch every morning. Unfortunately, I ran out of punch. I needed a tool to help me make something similar with the ingredients I had at hand that tastes similar to a Rum Punch so I could stop shaking. Questionable Cocktails was just the tool for me!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Karen (F35):</strong> “As a ‘Wine Mom’ with half a bottle of Chardonnay and some kid’s apple juice, I turned to Questionable Cocktails. It gave me the ‘Pickle-tini Surprise’—a wild mix of wine, juice, and leftover pickle brine. Was it good? Absolutely not. Did it do the trick? You bet. Thanks, Questionable Cocktails! The PTA meeting’s never been so tolerable.”</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Chad (M27):</strong> “Bro, I had like, a splash of vodka, three olives, and some Gatorade left. No clue what to do. Questionable Cocktails hit me with the ‘Hydration Station’—a mix of electrolytes and poor decisions. Tasted awful, but man, I was ready for anything. Thanks, Questionable Cocktails! Who needs bartenders when you’ve got AI and low standards?”</p>
